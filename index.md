## About me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the HPNALGS group at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), led by Prof. Laura Grigori. 
I have obtained my PhD at Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy) in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Michele Benzi. My PhD thesis is available [here](https://ricerca.sns.it/handle/11384/157683).

My research interests are in numerical linear algebra and scientific computing. Specifically, my research focuses on polynomial and rational Krylov subspace methods for computing matrix functions, and on randomized algorithms for linear algebra problems. I am also interested in trace estimation and in problems arising in network science, such as the computation of centrality measures and dynamics on graphs, that can be formulated in terms of matrix functions. You can find my CV [here](assets/files/cv-simunec.pdf).
